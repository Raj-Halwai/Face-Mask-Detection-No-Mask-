🛡️ Face Mask Detection using Deep Learning
This project is a Face Mask Detection system built using deep learning and computer vision techniques. It can accurately detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time from an image or webcam feed.

🔍 Features
Detects faces with or without masks
Built using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenC
Trained on a custom dataset with labeled images
Real-time prediction support via webcam or video feed

📁 Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)

💡 How It Works
Loads a pre-trained CNN model.
Detects faces from input using OpenCV.
Classifies each detected face as:
With Mask 😷
Without Mask 😷❌
